 .. _create_metadata:

Who
======================================================================

Only people with access to the administration restricted area can create and modify metadata for exercises.
To get these access you must be in the special group **github_user**, this group can view, edit and create metadata.

Only superuser can add someone to the **github_user** group via the admin interface. To associate a user to this group
the user must login first.

How
=======================================================================

To start working on the metadata choose on the left side menu "Admin: restricted access", then click on the blu arrow
<<Go to the metadata section>>.
This page contain a table and a list.
The table contains all the exercises  which have already metadata. Each column can be ordered, the number of rows can be selected,
and a search bar can be used to search a resource by title, background and access resource fields.
From this table the user can choose if publish or not on exoset library (the resource will be then visible for everyone) and
or add a flag. The flag is visible only for the github_user group and it is used to help the administration of the resources.
there are 3 flags:

    * Revise metadata: this flag must be used in case a correction is required for the existing metadata
    * Revise files: this flag must be used in case latex files and or figures must be revised due to errors and or changes
      are required.
    * Obsolete: when a version of an exercise must be kept and a new one has to be created. Using this flag will do none
      of the these actions, the user must stop publishing the exercise and also create the new one.

From this table one can choose if publish or not the exercise by clicking "yes" or "no" choice in the "Resource visible on
exoset" column. By choosing "yes" the resource will be visible by everyone on exoset webpage.
Under this table a list of resources not included in the table is available. This list includes all the exercises
